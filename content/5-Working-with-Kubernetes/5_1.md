# 05 WORKING WITH KUBERNETES

In this chapter, we will learn about the different Kubernetes objects, their purpose and how to interact with them.

After setting up a cluster or using an already existing one, we can start deploying some workload. The smallest compute unit in Kubernetes is not a container, but a Pod object. That being, a Pod is not the only abstraction we use for workload. Kubernetes has a variety of workload objects that control how Pods are deployed, scaled and managed.

Deploying the workload is not the only task a developer or administrator has to perform. Kubernetes has solutions for some inherent problems with containers and orchestration, be it configuration management, cross-node networking, routing of external traffic, load balancing or scaling of the pods.
