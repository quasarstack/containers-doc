# Chapter Overview

Kubernetes is a highly popular open-source container orchestration platform that can be used to automate deployment, scaling and the management of containerized workloads. In this chapter, we will discover the basic architecture of a Kubernetes cluster and its components. To learn even more Kubernetes basics, you can take the Linux Foundation's free [Introduction to Kubernetes (LFS158x)](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/introduction-to-kubernetes/) course on edX.

Originally designed and developed by Google, Kubernetes got open-sourced in 2014, and along the release v1.0 Kubernetes was donated to the newly formed Cloud Native Computing Foundation as the very first project. A lot of cloud native technologies evolve around Kubernetes, be it low-level tools like container runtimes, monitoring or application delivery tools.

Professionals with Kubernetes skills, be it administration or developing, are highly sought after since Kubernetes has become the centerpiece of a lot of modern cloud platforms.
