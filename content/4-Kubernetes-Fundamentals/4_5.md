# Running Containers on Kubernetes

How does running a container on your local machine differ from running containers in Kubernetes? In Kubernetes, instead of starting containers directly, you define Pods as the smallest compute unit and Kubernetes translates that into a running container. We will learn more about Pods later, for now imagine it as a wrapper around a container.

When you create a Pod object in Kubernetes, several components are involved in that process, until you get containers running a node.

Here is an example using Docker:

In an effort to allow using other container runtimes than Docker, Kubernetes introduced the [Container Runtime Interface (CRI)](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2016/12/container-runtime-interface-cri-in-kubernetes/) in 2016.

### Container Runtimes

- **containerd**
	[containerd](https://containerd.io/) is a lightweight and performant implementation to run containers. Arguably the most popular container runtime right now. It is used by all major cloud providers for the Kubernetes As A Service products.
	
- **CRI-O**
	[CRI-O](https://cri-o.io/) was created by Red Hat and with a similar code base closely related to podman and buildah.
	
- **Docker**
	The standard for a long time, but never really made for container orchestration. The usage of Docker as the runtime for Kubernetes has been deprecated and will be removed in Kubernetes 1.23. Kubernetes has a great [blog article](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/12/02/dont-panic-kubernetes-and-docker/) that answers all the questions on the matter.


**Container creation with containerd can be much simpler than with Docker**

The idea of containerd and CRI-O was very simple: provide a runtime that only contains the absolutely essentials to run containers. Nevertheless, they have additional features, like the ability to integrate with container runtime sandboxing tools. These tools try to solve the security problem that comes with sharing the kernel between multiple containers. The most common tools at the moment are:

-   [gvisor](https://github.com/google/gvisor)  
    Made by Google, provides an application kernel that sits between the containerized process and the host kernel.
-   [Kata Containers](https://katacontainers.io/)  
    A secure runtime that provides a lightweight virtual machine, but behaves like a container.
