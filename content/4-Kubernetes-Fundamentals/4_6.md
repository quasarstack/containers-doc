# Networking

Kubernetes networking can be very complicated and hard to understand. A lot of these concepts are not Kubernetes-related and were covered in the _Container Orchestration_ chapter. Again, we have to deal with the problem that a lot of containers need to communicate across a lot of nodes. Kubernetes distinguishes between four different networking problems that need to be solved:

1.  **Container-to-Container communications**  
> This can be solved by the Pod concept as we'll learn later.
2.  **Pod-to-Pod communications**  
> This can be solved with an overlay network.
3.  **Pod-to-Service communications**  
> It is implemented by the kube-proxy and packet filter on the node.
4.  **External-to-Service communications**  
> It is implemented by the kube-proxy and packet filter on the node.

There are different ways to implement networking in Kubernetes, but also three important requirements:

-   All pods can communicate with each other across nodes.
-   All nodes can communicate with all pods.
-   No Network Address Translation (NAT).

To implement networking, you can choose from a variety of network vendors like:

-   [Project Calico](https://www.tigera.io/project-calico/)
-   [Weave](https://www.weave.works/oss/net/)
-   [Cilium](https://cilium.io/)

In Kubernetes, every Pod gets its own IP address, so there is no manual configuration involved. Moreover, most Kubernetes setups include a DNS server add-on called [core-dns](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/coredns/), which can provide service discovery and name resolution inside the cluster.
