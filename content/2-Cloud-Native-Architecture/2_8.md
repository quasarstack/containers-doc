# Community and Governance

A lot of open source projects that are seen as industry standard by many are hosted and supported by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Projects are categorized according to maturity and go through a sandbox and incubation stage before graduating. The strong community of the CNCF can support projects throughout their whole lifecycle, starting with things like public visibility and classification in the [CNCF Landscape](https://www.cncf.io/projects/) until projects mature for production usage.

The CNCF has a Technical Oversight Committee (TOC) that is responsible for defining and maintaining the technical vision, approving new projects, accepting feedback from the end-user committee, and defining common practices that should be implemented in CNCF projects.

At the same time, the TOC does not control the projects, but encourages them to be self-governing and community owned and practices the principle of “minimal viable governance”. Guidelines for these projects include how projects are maintained, reviewed and released, what are its user and working groups, and much more. Since open source projects are dependent on their respective communities, governance is much different from traditional approaches. The great freedom of cloud native technologies forces people to impose rules on themselves and to enforce them.
