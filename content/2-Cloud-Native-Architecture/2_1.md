# 02 CLOUD NATIVE ARCHITECTURE

With the rise of cloud computing, the requirements and possibilities for developing, deploying and designing applications have changed significantly.

Cloud providers offer a variety of on-demand services, starting with simple (virtual-) servers, networking, storage, databases, and much more. Deploying and managing these services is very convenient, either interactively, or by using application programming interfaces (APIs).

In this chapter, you will learn about the principles of modern application architecture, often referred to as Cloud Native Architecture. We will discover what makes these applications _native_ to cloud systems and how they differ from traditional approaches.
