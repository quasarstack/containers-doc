# Open Standards

Many cloud native technologies rely heavily on open source software, which can make it much easier to get started and prevent vendor lock-in. Everyone can collaborate in an open source project, which makes it easy to implement industry-wide standards that even find their way in commercial products and cloud provider offerings.

A common problem is how to build and distribute software packages, since applications have a lot of requirements and dependencies for the underlying operating system and the application runtime. To overcome this problem, _containers_ evolved as a standardized way to package and ship modern software. While Docker is often used synonymously with container technologies, the community has committed to the open industry standard of the [Open Container Initiative (OCI)](https://opencontainers.org/).

Under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation, the Open Container Initiative provides two standards which define the way how to build and run containers. The [image-spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec) defines how to build and package container images. While the [runtime-spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec) specifies the configuration, execution environment and lifecycle of containers. A more recent addition to the OCI project is the [Distribution-Spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec), which provides a standard for the distribution of content in general and container images in particular.

Open standards like this help and complement other systems like Kubernetes, which is the _de facto_ standard platform for orchestrating containers. A few standards that will discover in the following chapters are:

-   [OCI Spec](https://opencontainers.org/): image, runtime and distribution specification on how to run, build an distribute containers
-   [Container Network Interface (CNI)](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni): A specification on how to implement networking for Containers.
-   [Container Runtime Interface (CRI)](https://github.com/kubernetes/cri-api): A specification on how to implement container runtimes in container orchestration systems.
-   [Container Storage Interface (CSI)](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec):A specification on how to implement storage in container orchestration systems.
-   [Service Mesh Interface (SMI)](https://smi-spec.io/): Ap specification on how to implement Service Meshes in container orchestration systems with a focus on Kubernetes.

Following this approach, other systems like Prometheus or OpenTelemetry evolved and thrived in this ecosystem and provide additional standards for monitoring and observability.
