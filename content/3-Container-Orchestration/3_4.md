# Running Containers

To run industry-standard containers, you don't need to use Docker; you can just follow the OCI [runtime-spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec) standard instead. The Open Container Initiative also maintains a container runtime reference implementation called [runC](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc). This low-level runtime is used in a variety of tools to start containers, including Docker itself.

If you're a developer and you know about object-oriented programming, you can imagine the relationship between the container image and the running container like a class and the instantiation of that class.

With Docker installed, you can start containers like this:

```bash
docker run nginx
```

The runtime-spec goes hand in hand with the image-spec, which we will cover in the next chapter, since it describes how to unpack a container image and then manage the complete container lifecycle, from creating the container environment, to starting the process, stopping and deleting it.

For your local machine, there are plenty of alternatives to choose from, some of which are only for building images like [buildah](https://buildah.io/) or [kaniko](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko), while others line up as full alternatives to Docker, like [podman](https://podman.io/) does.

Podman provides a similar API as Docker and can be used as a drop-in-replacement. Moreover, it comes with some additional features like running containers without root privileges and the usage of the Pod concept that we’ll discover later on.
