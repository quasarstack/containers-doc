# Networking

Microservice architecture depends heavily on network communication. Unlike in monolithic applications, a microservice implements an interface that can be called to make a request. For example, you could have a service that responds with a list of products in an e-commerce application.

Network namespaces allow each container to have its own unique IP address, therefore multiple applications can open the same network port; for example, you could have multiple containerized web servers that all open port 8080.

To make the application accessible from outside the host system, containers have the ability to map a port from the container to a port from the host system.

To allow communication between containers across hosts, we can use an overlay network which puts them in a virtual network that is spanned across the host systems.

This makes it very easy for containers to communicate with each other while system administrators don’t have to configure complex networking and routing between hosts and containers.

Most overlay networks also take care of IP address management, which would be a lot of work if implemented manually. In this case, the overlay network manages which container gets which IP address and how the traffic has to flow to access the individual containers.

Most modern implementations of container networking are based on the [Container Network Interface (CNI)](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni). CNI is a standard that can be used to write or configure network plugins and makes it very easy to swap out different plugins in various container orchestration platforms.
