# Service Mesh

Because the networking is such a crucial part of microservices and containers, the networking can get very complex and opaque for developers and administrators. In addition to that, a lot of functionality like monitoring, access control or encryption of the networking traffic is desired when containers communicate with each other.

Instead of implementing all of this functionality into your application, you can just start a second container that has this functionality implemented. The software you can use to manage network traffic is called a proxy. This is a server application that sits between a client and server and can modify or filter network traffic before it reaches the server. Popular representatives are [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/), [haproxy](http://www.haproxy.org/) or [envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/).

Taking this idea a step further, a service mesh adds a proxy server to _every_ container that you have in your architecture.

You can now use the proxies to handle network communication between your services.

Let’s take encryption as an example. If two or more applications should encrypt their traffic when they talk to each other, it would require adding libraries and configuration and management of digital certificates that prove the identity of the involved applications. That can be a lot of work and can also be error-prone if not done with special care.

When a service mesh is used, applications don’t talk to each other directly, but the traffic is routed through the proxies instead. The most popular service meshes at the moment are [istio](https://istio.io/) and [linkerd](https://linkerd.io/). While they have differences in implementation, the architecture is the same.

The proxies in a service mesh form the _data plane_. This is where networking rules are implemented and shape the traffic flow.

These rules are managed centrally in the _control plane_ of the service mesh. This is where you define how traffic flows from service A to service B and what configuration should be applied to the proxies.

So instead of writing code and installing libraries, you just write a config file where you tell the service mesh that service A and service B should always communicate encrypted. The config is then uploaded to the control plane and distributed to the data plane to enforce the new rule.

For a long time the term "service mesh" only described a basic idea of how traffic in container platforms could be handled with proxies. The [Service Mesh Interface (SMI)](https://smi-spec.io/) project aims at defining a specification on how a service mesh from various providers can be implemented. With a strong focus on Kubernetes, their goal is to standardize the end user experience for service meshes, as well as a standard for the providers that want to integrate with Kubernetes. You can find the current [specification](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec) on GitHub.
