# Building Container Images

Why is a container called a container in the first place? The metaphor used here is aimed at the use of shipping containers that are standardized according to [ISO 668](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_668). The standard format of a shipping container makes it easy to stack on a container ship, easy to unload with a crane and onto a truck no matter what’s inside. You will see that many terms in the container and cloud native world follow this nautical theme.

Docker reused all components to isolate processes like namespaces and cgroups, but a crucial piece of the puzzle that helped containers achieve their breakthrough is the introduction of _container images._

Container images are what makes containers portable and easy to reuse on a variety of systems. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container) describes a container image as following:

_“A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.”_

In 2015, the image format made popular by Docker was donated to the newly founded Open Container Initiative and is known also as the [OCI image-spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec) that can be found on GitHub. Images consist of a filesystem bundle and metadata.

### Container Images

Images can be built by reading the instructions from a buildfile called _Dockerfile_**.** The instructions are almost the same as one would use to install an application on a server. Here is an example of a Dockerfile that containerizes a Python script:

```docker
**# Every container image starts with a base image.  
# This could be your favorite linux distribution  
FROM ubuntu:20.04** 

**# Run commands to add software and libraries to your image  
# Here we install python3 and the pip package manager  
RUN apt-get update && \  
    apt-get -y install python3 python3-pip** 

**# The copy command can be used to copy your code to the image  
# Here we copy a script called "my-app.py" to the containers filesystem  
COPY my-app.py /app/** 

**# Defines the workdir in which the application runs  
# From this point on everything will be executed in /app  
WORKDIR /app**

**# The process that should be started when the container runs  
# In this case we start our python app "my-app.py"  
CMD ["python3","my-app.py"]**
```

If you have installed Docker on your machine, you can build the image with the following command:

```bash
docker build -t my-python-image -f Dockerfile
```

With the parameters **-t my-python-image** you can specify a name tag for your image, and with **-f Dockerfile** you specify where your Dockerfile can be found. This gives developers the ability to manage all the dependencies of their application and packaging it ready to run instead of leaving that task to another person or team.

To distribute these images, you can use a container registry. This is nothing more than a web server where you can upload and download images. Conveniently, Docker has the **push** and **pull** commands built-in:

```bash
docker push my-registry.com/my-python-image  
docker pull my-registry.com/my-python-image
```
