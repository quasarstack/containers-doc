# Storage

From a storage perspective, containers have a significant flaw: they are ephemeral. To understand what the means exactly we need to understand what happens when a container gets started from a container image.

Generally speaking, container images are read-only and consist of different layers that include everything that you added during the build phase. That ensures that every time you start a container from an image you get the same behavior and functionality. As you probably can imagine, a lot of applications need to write files. To allow writing files, a read-write layer is put on top of the container image when you start a container from an image.

The problem here is that this read-write layer is lost when the container is stopped or deleted. Just like the memory of your computer gets erased when you shut it down. To persist data, you need to write it to your disk. 

If a container needs to persist data on a host, a _volume_ can be used to achieve that. The concept and technology for that is quite simple: instead of isolating the whole filesystem of a process, directories that reside on the host are passed through into the container filesystem. If you think that this weakens the isolation of the container, you’re right. When container volumes are used, you effectively give access to the host filesystem.

**Data is shared between two containers on the same host**

When you orchestrate a lot of containers, persisting the data on the host where the container was started might not be the only challenge. Often, data needs to be accessed by multiple containers that are started on different host systems or when a container gets started on a different host it still should have access to its volume.

Container orchestration systems like Kubernetes can help to mitigate these problems, but always require a robust storage system that is attached to the host servers.

**Storage is provisioned via a central storage system. Containers on Server A and Server B can share a volume to read and write data**

In order to keep up with the unbroken growth of various storage implementations, again, the solution was to implement a standard. The [Container Storage Interface (CSI)](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec) came up to offer a uniform interface which allows attaching different storage systems no matter if it’s cloud or on-premises storage.
